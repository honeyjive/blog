	<h1>First Week at MakerSquare</h1>
	<p align="middle">
		<em>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</em> -Lao-tzu
	</p>
	<p>
		While it feels more like a crawl than a first step, my official journey to become front-end developer embarked on the 8th of September.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first day of any occasion for me is always filled with hopeful anticipation with anxiety and dread thrown in the mix. Granted, I was probably not the only one. Day 1 consisted of installing multiple programs to my computer. Programs such as Brew, Sublime Text, GitHub, XCode, and etc. I admit that I am still unsure to the function of some of the installed programs.

		The second day of MakerSquare was a bit more challenging. Here I was introduced to our first project: the blog. Before this class I believed that I at least had some sort of grasp on HTML and CSS. I quickly realized that while one can remember in theory of how things are supposed to work, rarely to they ever on the first try. On top of that, throw in Git Command Line, something I had never encountered before. After a lapse of panicked typing of git commands into Terminal, I was guided back on track by the MS instructors. Praise, hallelujah.

	<p>Key Things to Remember:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>For a baby beginner using Git Command Line: work + add + commit (and repeat) +  push.</li>
		<li>Review, review, REVIEW!</li>
		<li>Google is your friend, it's okay to look something up.</li>
	</ol>
